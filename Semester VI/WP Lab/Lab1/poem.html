	    I wandered lonely as a <b>cloud</b> <br>
		That floats on high o'er vales and <b>hills</b>, <br>
		When all at once I saw a <b>crowd</b>, <br>
		A host, of golden <b>daffodils</b>; <br>
		Beside the lake, beneath the <b>trees</b>, <br>
		Fluttering and dancing in the <b>breeze</b>. <br>
		<br>
		Continuous as the stars that <b>shine</b> <br>
		And twinkle on the milky <b>way</b>, <br>
		They stretched in never-ending <b>line</b> <br>
		Along the margin of a <b>bay</b>: <br>
		Ten thousand saw I at a <b>glance</b>, <br>
		Tossing their heads in sprightly <b>dance</b>. <br>
		<br>
		The waves beside them danced; but <b>they</b> <br>
		Out-did the sparkling waves in <b>glee</b>: <br>
		A poet could not but be <b>gay</b>, <br>
		In such a jocund company</b>: <br>
		I gazed—and gazed—but little <b>thought</b> <br>
		What wealth the show to me had <b>brought</b>. <br>
		<br>
		For oft, when on my couch I <b>lie</b> <br>
		In vacant or in pensive <b>mood</b>, <br>
		They flash upon that inward <b>eye</b> <br>
		Which is the bliss of <b>solitude</b>; <br>
		And then my heart with pleasure <b>fills</b>, <br>
		And dances with the <b>daffodils</b>. <br>
